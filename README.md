# promptsity

Build dynamic prompts, without the hassle.

## Overview

The [Prompts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prompts) package empowers users to craft engaging and interactive prompts. Within these prompts, users are presented with questions, and they can respond using a variety of prompt types, such as text, number, select, and multiselect.

However, for users seeking to incorporate advanced logic and dependencies based on previous answers, the process can become intricate. That's where Promptsity steps in, offering a streamlined solution through the use of just a JSON.
